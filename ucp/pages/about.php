							<h2>Server Features</h2>
							<p>Our aim with Valhalla Gaming MTA Role Play is to develop innovative features that take role play in Grand Theft Auto to the next level. Below are just a few of the features we have brought to you.</p>

							<div class="floatRight"><img src="/images/presentationScreen.jpg" align="right" style="padding-left:20px;"/><h6>Examples of the use of GUIs.</h6></div>
							<h3>Presentation</h3>
							<p>Unlike SAMP scripts, MTA allows us to make use of GUIs to present information and menus creating a more aesthetically pleasing server. This means lists and reams of text no longer need to clog up your chat box and slow down your dramatic role play situations. Add to that the sleek analogue speedometer and fuel gauges and camera effects and you will agree that no role play server has ever been so pleasing on the eye.</p>
							
							
							<h3>Accounts</h3>
							<p>Our account system means you only ever need to register once no matter how many characters you want to create. That means you only have to prove yourself by take the tutorial once and creating new characters takes literally a minute. The account menu allows you to see all the characters you have created, view the achievements you have collected while playing in the server and manage account options such as toggling motion blur</p>
							
							
							<div class="floatRight"><img src="/images/itemScreen.png" align="left" style="padding-right:20px;"/><h6>The personal inventory window.</h6></div>
							<h3>Item System</h3>
							<p>All players have a personal inventory which they use to carry items for later use. Items range from food to replenish health to weapons to do the exact opposite. You can drop and collect items from all over the game world as well as purchase items from several different shop types.</p>
							
							
							<h3>500+ Houses and businesses</h3>
							<p>The server has over 300 houses which can be purchased by players with the capacity to create more on the spot as they are needed. Players can request any property in the game world in the Property Request section of the forum. Every street has a name and every house has an address. All this is aimed at creating the atmosphere of a real living, breathing city.</p>
							
							
							<div class="floatRight"><img src="/images/tagScreen.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right:20px;"/><h6>A gang tag sprayed on a wall.</h6></div>
							<div class="floatLeft"><img src="/images/factionScreen.jpg" align="right" style="padding-left:20px;"/><h6>One of Valhalla Gaming MTA's factions.</h6></div>							
							<h3>Spray Gang Tags Anywhere</h3>
							<p>The tagging system allows players to spray a graffiti tag on any wall on the map. Gangs can now mark out their territory using graffiti tags meaning there is no need for out of date turf maps posted on forums. As if that isn't enough, the gang tags mods for official gang factions are server side meaning everyone who plays in the server will see your gangs tag around your turf without the need to download and install the mod manually.</p>
							
							<h3 style="clear:right;">Factions</h3>
							<p>The official factions of Valhalla Gaming MTA are provided with a faction menu that makes organising factions easier than ever. Iniviting, kicking, promoting, demoting, setting rank names and wages are all handled in one place.</p>
							
							<h3 style="clear:left;">Mapping and NPCs</h3>
							<p>We have gone to great lengths to add objects and NPCs to the game map to enrich the city environment. You may have played in Los Santos before, but you have never played in our Los Santos.</p>
							<img src="/images/mappingScreen.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right:20px;"/><h6 style="margin:0;">Custom mapped Los Santos harbour.</h6>
							
							<div class="floatRight"><img src="/images/drugScreen.jpg" align="right" style="padding-left:20px;"/><h6>Client side drug effects.</h6></div>
							<h3>As well as all that we have...</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Jobs.</li>
								<li>Personal vehicles you can lock with a key.</li>
								<li>No vehicle model limit and enough cars for everyone to own their as many as they can afford to buy.</li>
								<li>Achievements to collect.</li>
								<li>A social networking system that allows you to keep in touch with friends.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>and so much more...</p>
